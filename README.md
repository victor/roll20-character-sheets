Roll20 Character Sheets
=======================

This repository is the collection of all the community-contributed character sheets that are available for use on Roll20. 

Contributing
============

If you want to help improve an existing sheet, just clone this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. If you would like to contribute a new sheet for the community to use, just clone this repository and create a new folder with the name of the game system that the sheet is for. Then send a pull request. If you have any questions or aren't familiar with Github or git in general, feel free to drop us a line at team@roll20.net and we can help you get set up.

**Creating a sheet.json File**

When you are ready to submit your template for **public use**, create a `sheet.json` file in your sheet's folder (see the kitchensink folder for an example sheet.json file). The file has the following fields:

* `html`: The name of the HTML file for the sheet (e.g. `kitchensink.html`)
* `css`: The name of the CSS file for the sheet (e.g. `kitchensink.css`)
* `authors`: A simple string telling who contributed toward the sheet (e.g. `Riley Dutton`)
* `preview`: The name of an image file which should be included in your sheet folder showing a preview/screenshot of the sheet (will be displayed in-app at 500x500 resolution) (e.g. `kitchensink.png`)
* `instructions`: Markdown-formatted instructions for using the sheet. If there are any particular setup steps, special rolls you want to make the player aware of, etc., this is the place to put that info. Try to be succinct.

After we have reviewed your sheet if we approve it we will add it to the `approved.yaml` file in the root directory which will cause it to be available to everyone on the main Roll20 site. If we reject your sheet, we will comment on your Github commit and let you know what changes need to be made before it can be accepted. 

Guidelines
==========

Here are a few guidelines that you should follow when contributing sheets for the community:

**Make it Familiar**

The sheet for each game type should be familiar to players who are used to seeing the paper version of that sheet. It shouldn't be identical or violate any copyright, but it also shouldn't be laid out in such a crazy way that players will have a hard time understanding how to use it. **Design for ease of us first and foremost.** Along those lines, keep your UI changes simple -- please don't change the basic functionality of how a checkbox works, for example.

**Add Rolls**

The best sheets not only keep track of character stats, they have most of the rolls for the game system embedded in them. This makes it much easier for new players to play the game (just "click on that button on the sheet" versus "Make a macro, okay put slash roll one dee twenty..."). While you don't have to include every roll in the whole system, including the most common ones where appropriate can really help elevate your sheet to the next level.

**Don't Duplicate Work**

We only need one sheet for each system. For some major systems like Pathfinder or D&D, we may allow more than one sheet if they are different enough, but contact us in advance before you spend a lot of time working on a new sheet for a game we already have a sheet for. We should focus on improving existing sheets, not creating totally new ones. Along those lines, this is a community effort, so if you want to help improve an existing sheet, just jump in and do so.

**Use Standard Attribute Names**

Whenever possible, use standard names for attributes, spelled out. For example, "Intelligence", "Strength", and "Wisdom". This is important so that if a Character is imported into a game with a different sheet, most of the values will be able to transition. If the attribute names are all different, then nothing can be imported. Your best bet is to look at existing sheets and whenever possible use the same attribute names that are already in use.


**No Character Creation or Advancement**

Due to copyright restrctions, please don't attempt to include functionality for advancing a character automatically to the next level or creating a new character from scratch automatically. It's fine to have attributes that auto-calculate based on other attributes (including the current level). We'll let you know if your submitted sheet violates this rule.
