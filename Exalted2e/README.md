## _Exalted, Second Edition_ Character Sheet

This character sheet is a work in progress.

Character sheet for _Exalted, Second Edition_ by White Wolf Publishing.

### NOTE

`exalted2e.css` and `exalted2e.html` **must** be saved with Unicode encoding. Using Unicode character codes does not currently work with the character sheet system, so the characters themselves must be used. Saving the file as ANSI, etc. will break the appearance of the character sheet.
