With the most notable exception being that you can roll Arete and Willpower directy from the sheet.  Also, The Dice Pool section in the center at the bottom allow one to select an Attribute and/or Ability to roll.  All rolls from the sheet are of the from {Xd10!}>Df1, where X is the number of dice and D is the difficulty.  These roll do not recognize botches. Further, the rolls will prompt the user to modify the number of dice rolled and set the difficuly.  The defaults for these are 0 and 6 repectively."
